# Data Science for Finance (FNCE 2370) Project: Startup Success Prediction

## Project Introduction

Accurately predicting startup success is central to venture capital (VC). The difficulty behind this is understanding which startups are primed to thrive, and consistently identifying them. A 2018 study describes the failure rate of startups– of those that started in 2014, only 56% made it to the fifth year. That is, 44% fail within the first 4 years of their inception. For an investor, these statistics are far from ideal. Other studies go as far as to state: “around 90% of startups are unsuccessful”. Yet, venture capitalists still heavily invest in startups, despite “the typical loss rate for early-stage investments being 65%. This means that 35% must generate gains much greater than 1x to achieve an acceptable overall result”. These numbers point to the fact that startups can be extremely risky investments, especially if not carefully researched.

Furthermore, knowing what impacts the success of a startup also benefits entrepreneur hopefuls who are just starting out. Being informed on factors such as the best places to found a startup, the number of participants, and the level of funding necessary helps influence entrepreneurs to put themselves in the best position possible to succeed. As computer science students interested in starting or joining early stage tech startups and VC funds, we are personally invested in finding out what features make a startup successful. We hope to use the results of our project to aid in our recruitment process and potentially in our future startup pursuits.

This sets up the motivations behind our project - to understand the key factors critical to startup success by developing a machine learning model that is able to predict the likelihood of success of a startup, given key data such as its location, industry verticals, funding, and more. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an accurate model, such that we minimize the number of false positive predictions, as these are more costly in real life (i.e. investing in a startup that is predicted to succeed but actually fails).

We will work with a dataset compiled by GMO, an investment management firm based in Boston. The data contains company information, investment insights, and industry trends of the startups operating between 2005 and 2012.

## Research Questions

- Can we predict the likelihood of success for a given startup in the US?
- If so, which factors are most important for a startup to succeed?
